Definition: A project charter details the objectives/goals of a project. It also focuses on the scope and the people involved in the project. It is generally a short document that is used to signify these aspects of the project while in the process of creating it. It is used constantly throughout the creation of the project as it documents the progress made and also any changes made to the project.
